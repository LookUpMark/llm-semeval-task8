Any solution to climate change must reduce greenhouse gasses in two ways: by stopping further emissions, and by drawing carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere through “sequestration,” which traps it in the ground and in vegetation.\nSequestration is greatly aided by the presence of parks because healthy open space acts as a natural carbon sink.

First, the condition of the General Fund has deteriorated significantly in the intervening months, making it much more likely that the state will need to adopt significant budget reductions and/or revenue increases. Second, the magnitude of the costs and implications of the 66‑hour workweek change have become much clearer. We now know that when fully implemented, the proposal would have very large state costs, eventually totaling over $750 million annually from the General Fund. Additionally, the administration’s proposed approach would have significant effects on CalFire, resulting in a roughly 20 percent increase in the department’s budget and staffing levels and expanding its operations during months that are relatively low‑risk for wildfires. These changes would, in turn, have various direct and indirect operational impacts on both CalFire and other partner agencies.

First, the condition of the General Fund has deteriorated significantly in the intervening months, making it much more likely that the state will need to adopt significant budget reductions and/or revenue increases. Second, the magnitude of the costs and implications of the 66‑hour workweek change have become much clearer. We now know that when fully implemented, the proposal would have very large state costs, eventually totaling over $750 million annually from the General Fund. Additionally, the administration’s proposed approach would have significant effects on CalFire, resulting in a roughly 20 percent increase in the department’s budget and staffing levels and expanding its operations during months that are relatively low‑risk for wildfires. These changes would, in turn, have various direct and indirect operational impacts on both CalFire and other partner agencies. These impacts—some of which are still not fully clear—were certainly not apparent to the Legislature when it approved the Unit 8 MOU."}, {"document_id": "dbca74cd38322488-104018-106331", "score": 0.0, "text": "Conclusion\nTo help address the complex drivers of disproportionalities and disparities present throughout California’s child welfare system, key front‑end policy areas for the Legislature to consider include mandated reporting, general neglect definition and data, decision‑making tools and training, and prevention services. At the same time, counties’ current efforts to implement comprehensive prevention plans offer the Legislature a significant monitoring and oversight opportunity, which can help the Legislature assess what additional policy and practice changes could be warranted. Whatever reforms the Legislature chooses to undertake will need to continue to prioritize child safety in all cases, while seeking to strengthen families and mitigate trauma. More broadly, given the CDC risk and protective factors for child maltreatment, other areas and programs—such as economic supports, behavioral health, education, and public safety—can play important maltreatment mitigation roles as well. Examining how these programs could more effectively serve families at risk for child maltreatment could help the Legislature further address child welfare disproportionalities and disparities."}, {"document_id": "dbca74cd38322488-104018-106331", "score": 0.0, "text": "California’s Child Welfare System: Addressing Disproportionalities and Disparities\nCertainly, reducing the disproportionalities and disparities experienced by low‑income, Black, and Native American families across California’s child welfare system will take time. To help ensure ongoing accountability and continued progress, we suggest the Legislature could consider working with DSS—in consultation with stakeholders—to determine specific targets for reducing these disproportionalities and disparities over time. For example, the Department of Health Care Services as part of its 2022 Comprehensive Quality Strategy committed to reducing five key areas of health disparities by 50 percent by 2025. Similarly, the state could consider establishing specific near‑term and longer‑term goals for reducing disproportionalities and disparities across the child welfare system. \nConclusion"}]}

But $12k or whatever is not a ton of money.  If you do need a car and will have to replace it if you sell it then selling it is likely not a good idea. If it is because you want a nicer car and can afford to upgrade, then selling it is likely a good idea.  The fact that you have had it for years and not paid off the loan tells me this situation is unlikely. You should think of the value of your car to you (and the potential cost of replacing it) and the amount of money you owe on it as two different things.  The debt you have is a debt that you will need to pay no matter what you do with the car or how its value changes.  The value of the car to you is pretty much a separate issue from how much you have outstanding in debt.   If you want to sell the car to pay off the debt that is fine if you don't need the car or if you can get a suitable replacement car for MUCH less (which I find"}]}

When you pay with a credit card, it is typically only authorized - the issuing bank says \"\"I'm setting this money aside for this transaction\"\", but no money actually changes hands.  You'll typically see this on your statement as a \"\"pending\"\" charge.  Only later, in a process called \"\"settlement\"\", does your bank actually send money to the merchant's bank.
